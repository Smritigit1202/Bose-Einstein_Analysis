# Bose-Einstein_Analysis

This project investigates the fascinating quantum mechanical phenomenon of Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) through the lens of bosonic statistics. First predicted by Albert Einstein in 1924 based on the work of Satyendra Nath Bose, BEC is a macroscopic quantum state that emerges at ultra-low temperatures, where a significant fraction of bosons occupy the systemâ€™s ground state. This project combines theoretical analysis and computational modeling to simulate the behavior of ideal bosons confined in harmonic traps, both in classical and quantum frameworks.
As a group, our objective was to not only explore the mathematical foundations of BEC, but also to translate those principles into computational models that yield visual and statistical outputs. Through a series of Python-based simulations, we studied how bosons behave under thermal fluctuations and how macroscopic occupation of the ground state arises as the temperature is lowered.
To compare distinguishable and indistinguishable particle behaviors using density matrices and permutation cycles.


To examine physical signatures of BEC such as macroscopic ground state occupation and boson bunching.
